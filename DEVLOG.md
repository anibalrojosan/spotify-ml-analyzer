# 📝 Development Log

This document serves as a chronological record of the **Spotify ML Analyzer** development. Here, I document technical decisions, challenges faced, solutions, and lessons learned.

The goal is to maintain transparency throughout the process and generate a clear history of my "train of thought."

## [2025-12-26] - Step 0

**Focus:** Environment setup and architecture definition.

### Today's Objectives
1. Define the project structure (Monorepo).
2. Configure Git and ignore rules (`.gitignore`) for a hybrid environment (Python/Node).
3. Establish the initial Roadmap following the "Walking Skeleton" strategy.

### Technical Decisions
* **Monorepo Architecture:** I decided to keep the Backend (`django`) and Frontend (`react`) within a single repository. Although they might be deployed separately in production, keeping them together facilitates local development and API type management at this MVP stage.
* **Branching Strategy:** I will use a simplified Git Flow strategy. `main` for production/stable code, and `feat/...` or `fix/...` branches for every ticket in the Kanban board.

### Progress
- Repository initialized and connected to GitHub.
- `.gitignore` file configured to avoid uploading sensitive files (`.env`) or heavy dependencies (`node_modules`, `venv`).

### Next Steps
- Initialize the Django and React (Vite) projects.
- Successfully run both servers simultaneously on my local machine.

## [2025-12-26] - Day 1: Walking Skeleton

**Focus:** Backend and Frontend environment installation (Issue #2).

### Progress
- Successfully initialized the Django project using `uv`.
- Created the React frontend using Vite.
- **Milestone Reached:** Both servers (Django at port 8000 and React at port 5173) are running simultaneously. The "Walking Skeleton" is done!

### Challenges & Solutions
* **Node.js Version Conflict:**
    * **The Problem:** While setting up the frontend, `npm run dev` failed. The default Linux repository provided Node v18.19.1, but the latest version of Vite requires Node v20+ or v22+.
    * **The Fix:** Instead of relying on the system's `apt` package manager, I installed **NVM (Node Version Manager)** so I can install Node v22 cleanly without sudo permissions.
    * **Lesson:** Always check engine requirements for modern frontend tools; system defaults may be outdated.

**Focus:** Data Acquisition Strategy & Initial EDA Pipeline

### Progress:
- Data Source: Acquired a comprehensive dataset of ~30,000 Spotify tracks to serve as a local development proxy.
- Data Cleaning: Implemented cleaning logic using Pandas, specifically addressing duplicates and null values to ensure data integrity.
- EDA: Started Exploratory Data Analysis to understand feature distributions (valence, energy, etc.) before modeling.

### Challenges & Solutions:
- **Challenge:** Encountered authentication blockers with the Spotify for Developers API, which halted the backend integration.
- **Solution (Pivot):** Adopted a "Local Simulation" strategy. Instead of waiting on the API, I decided to use a static dataset to mock API responses. This allows the Data Science work to proceed in parallel while the authentication issues are resolved.

**Focus:** Psychometric validation & Dimensional reduction
### Progress: 
- **Statistical Sanity Check**: Computed correlation matrices to identify multicollinearity. Confirmed that Valence and Energy are orthogonal (independent) dimensions in this dataset, validating their use as separate axes.
- **Affective Mapping**: Implemented Russell’s Circumplex Model, plotting 30k tracks on the Valence-Energy plane to visualize emotional quadrants.
- **Genre Clustering (Attempt 1)**: Visualized genre centroids to test if genre labels could predict emotional states. (Preliminary results suggest significant overlap).

## [2026-01-01]

**Focus**: Variance analysis & Backend rule definition
### Progress:
- **Distribution Profiling**: Transitioned from centroid analysis to **Boxplot Distribution** analysis. Examined the variance of Valence, Energy, and Tempo across genres.
- **Key Architectural Insight**: Discovered that mainstream genres (Pop, Latin) have high variance in emotional features, making them poor predictors of mood. Conversely, genres like EDM and Rock showed high rigidity in intensity.
- **Backend Specification**: Defined the logic for the **Psychological Profile Engine**:
    - Mood: Must be calculated at the **Track-Level** (atomic).
    - Intensity: Can use Genre-Level heuristics (e.g., EDM implies High Energy).
